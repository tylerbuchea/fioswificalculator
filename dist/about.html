        <h3>How can I identify FiOS WiFi?</h3>
        <p> They can be identified by the structure of their
        name. They are always five digits long
        and usually consist of random numbers and
        letters; example: "M3OV6" or "E3X12".</p>
      </li>

      <li class="topcoat-list__item">
        <h3>Why are there two passwords generated?</h3>
        <p>Because of the way they created the passwords 
        there will always be two possible passwords. One of which 
        will be the correct one you are looking for, so try both.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="topcoat-list__item">
        <h3>Why can't I connect using the calculated passwords?</h3>
        <p>First make sure you've typed everything in 
        correctly zero's may look like O's, ones like L's, 
        and so on. Copy and paste calculated passwords to avoid 
        miss types.</p>
      </li> 

      <li class="topcoat-list__item">
        <h3>I typed it in right what's wrong?</h3>
        <p>There could be a few issues. Either your not 
        connecting to a factory FiOS router, the default password 
        has been changed, or it is a third generation router.
        Third generation routers use a different algorithm, rendering this 
        application useless.</p>
